# Weather Web-App

**This is a simple weather app I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows the real-time weather based on your location (if you allow GPS access). If you don’t give access, it won’t work.**

## Made with Html, Css & JS

### I used **[weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)** to get the weather data
