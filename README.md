# Weather Web-App

**This is a simple weather web-app. It shows the real-time weather based on your location (if you allow GPS access). If you don’t give access, it won’t work.**

### I took the design from [this site](https://www.behance.net/gallery/221501409/Weather-App).

### I used **[weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)** to get the weather data

## Made with Html, Css & JS
