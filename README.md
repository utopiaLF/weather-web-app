**This is a single-page web app that shows real-time weather based on your GPS location. It stores data in localStorage and wonâ€™t work without location permission. You can also manually refresh your location** <br>

## Tech Stack:
 - **HTML**
 - **CSS**
 - **Vanilla JavaScript**

### Note: Mobile-first, but works well on larger screens too
